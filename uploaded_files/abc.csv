Your code is well-structured but has a few areas that might cause issues. I'll highlight possible problems without significantly changing your code.

Issues Identified:
Frontend (Streamlit):

uploaded_file in st.file_uploader: The accept_multiple_files=True parameter allows multiple file uploads, but you are treating uploaded_file as a single file. This will raise an error.
Fix: Use a loop to handle multiple uploaded files or restrict the uploader to a single file.
File Content Type: Ensure uploaded_file.content_type is correctly accessed, as it may not always provide valid content types for all file formats.
Backend (FastAPI):

get_file_loaders Function:
It processes only the last uploaded file due to overwriting the loader in the loop. Ensure all uploaded files are processed.
File Upload Path:
No validation is performed for file.filename, which can lead to directory traversal attacks.
Global Variable vectorstore:
Using global vectorstore for state management can lead to concurrency issues if multiple users access the app simultaneously.
utils.py:

get_file_loaders Logic:
The function may return an incorrect loader if no valid file type matches.
Handling extensions dynamically is better for scalability.
create_vectorstore:
If QDRANT_URL or QDRANT_KEY is invalid, the app will fail without handling this gracefully.
generate_response:
The rag_chain.invoke(question) might fail if the retriever returns no documents or the LLM model has an issue.
Highlighted Updates:
